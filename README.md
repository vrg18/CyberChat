#CyberChat project
##Information:
####*The project involves creating a simple chat CyberChat in order to test skills.*

Chat is built on the principle of rooms. The room can be private (only participants see and write) or shared (see everything, only participants write). Everyone can create a new room. By clicking on the username, a new private room with two participants is created (or opens, if already). Each room has an owner (usually a creator) who can add/remove members and delegate ownership. When self-registering, the user receives minimal rights, but allowing him to be a full-fledged chat participant. Additionally, there are the rights of a moderator (management of all rooms) and administrator (management of all rooms, users and their rights).

The finished application is deployed at http://159.69.208.196:8080 and is available for use.  
For testing purposes, you can log in as a user with administrative rights: simbirsoft/444  

The bot is also presented, which in response to any message sends a link to a random article on Habr. Articles for one user are not repeated.

Assembly and launch environment requirements:  
JDK version 8.212
